### Machine Learning Classification Tasks

These notebooks are part of the Modeling Learning with Artificial Intelligence course. In one notebook, a model is trained to classify binary EEG signals from a psychological experiment to determine whether or not the signals correspond to P300. In another, we classify EMG data to detect different movement actions.

Both tasks were implemented using Scikit-Learn, applying a variety of machine learning techniques, which resulted in well-performing models.
